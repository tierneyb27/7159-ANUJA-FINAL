The first method addressed is memoization (top-down), eliminates redundant recursive calls by storing results of previous computations. The secnod method addressed is bottom-up approach, which will build solution to incrementally from small subproblems. The two methods reduce the time complexity to Ο(nxt), where \"n\" represents the number od elements and \"t\" represents the target sum.\n","\n","The key idea here in the dynacmic programming is that whenever we try to insert a new element  xk+1  into the set, achievable sums can be determined by beginning with existing sums and adding  xk+1  to each one of them. This insight allows us to construct solution piecewise, instead of needing to try all possible combinations.\n","\n","My experimentation and testing confirms that the both approaches produce the same outputs, albeit with significant speed improvements. The bottom up approach technique also precludes the risk of stack overflow inherent with deep recursion in the memoization technique.\n","\n","Lastly, Subset Sum Problem is an excellent illustration of dynamic programming that transforms a computationally expensive exponential time problem into a far more manageable polynomial-time solution. This optimization is a significant concept in algorithm design and it finds a very broad application to the many problems beyond Subset Sum Problem."],"metadata":{"id":"TkeWegJzc2OG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lFZDNYTmPI7h"},"source":["# List of references\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["* Freimer, M., & Howard, R.
